def set2zero(project, data_types=[], grid_models=[]):
    """
    This method is a utility in order to set surface and 3D grid property data
    to 0 values. The purpose of it is to make sure that those data are properly
    generated by the modelling workflow and not inherited from a previous run
    with the corresponding jobs deactivated. The data are set to 0 value and
    not deleted in order not to reset some jobs in RMS.

    Expected arguments are:
        project: roxar magical keyword to refer to the current RMS project

        data_types: list of Str of RMS horizons category like "DS_extracted"
            All surfaces within the horizons categories listed will be set to
            zero if the surface is defined. No surface modified if omitted.

            Example: data_types = ['DS_extracted',
                                   'DS_surfaces_ert',
                                   'DS_extracted_for_aps']

        grid_models: list of Str of names RMS 3D grid models
            All 3D grid properties within the grid models listed will be set to
            zero if the property is defined. No property modified if omitted

            Example: grid_models = ['Geogrid', 'Simgrid', 'Eclipsegrid']

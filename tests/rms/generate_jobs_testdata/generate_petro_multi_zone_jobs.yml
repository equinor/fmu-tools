# Name of grid model for the petrophysics jobs
grid_name: MultiZoneBox

# Name of original petro job using facies realization as input
original_job_name: original_multi_zone

# Use empty string as zone name for single zone grids and zone name for multizone grids.
# For each zone, specify facies and for each facies specify
# petro variables to be used as field parameters in ERT update

# Example for a multizone grid with three zones:
used_petro_var:
  Zone1: 
    F1: [P1, P2]
    F2: [P1, P2]
    F3: [P1, P2]
  Zone2:
    F1:  [P1, P2]
    F2:  [P1, P2]
    F3:  [P1, P2]

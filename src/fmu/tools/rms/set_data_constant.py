def set_data_constant(config: Dict):
    """Set data from RMS constant.

    This method is a utility in order to set surface and 3D grid property data
    to a given value. The value must be of the correct type (if discrete 3D
    property for example). The purpose of it is to make sure that those data
    are properly generated by the modelling workflow and not inherited from a
    previous run with the corresponding jobs deactivated. The data are set to a
    value triggering attention and not deleted in order not to reset some jobs
    in RMS.

    The input of this method is a Python dictionary with defined keys. The keys
    "project" and "value" are required while "horizons", "zones" and
    "grid_models" are optional (at least one of them should be provided for the
    method to have any effect).

    Args:
        project: The roxar magic keyword ``project`` refering to the current
            RMS project.

        value: The constant value to assign to the data. It could be 0 or -999
            for example. If discrete properties from grid models are modified,
            the value should be applicable (integer).


        horizons: A Python dictionary where each key corresponds to the name of
            the horizons category where horizon data need to be made empty. The
            value associated to this key should be a list of horizon names to
            modify. If a string ``all`` is assigned instead of a list, all
            available horizon names for this category will be used.
            Alternatively, if a list of horizons categories is given instead of
            a dictionary, the method will apply to all horizons within these
            horizons categories.

        zones: A Python dictionary where each key corresponds to the name of
            the zones category where zone data need to be made empty. The value
            associated to this key should be a list of zone names to modify. If
            a string ``all`` is assigned instead of a list, all available zone
            names for this category will be used.
            Alternatively, if a list of zones categories is given instead of a
            dictionary, the method will apply to all zones within these zones
            categories.

        grid_models: A Python dictionary where each key corresponds to the name
            of the grid models where properties need to be made empty. The
            value associated to this key should be a list of property names to
            modify. If a string ``all`` is assigned instead of a list, all
            available properties for this grid model name will be used.
            Alternatively, if a list of grid models names is given instead of a
            dictionary, the method will apply to all properties within these
            grid models.

    The QCforward class which has a set of QC functions that can be ran from
    either RMS python, or on disk. The input `data` will be
    somewhat different for the two run environents.

    It should be easy to add new functions to this class. The idea is to reuse
    as much as possible, and principles are:

    * For the client (user), the callings scripts shall be lean

    * All methods shal have a rich documention with examples, i.e. it shall
      be possible for users with less skills in scripting to copy/paste and then modify
      to their needs.
